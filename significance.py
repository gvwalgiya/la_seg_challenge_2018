significance.py
Test to see if there are significant differences in intensity values between samples and within samples for each method of standardising. 

There shouldn't be because the intensity/contrast does not actually mean anything in terms of where the LA is.

significance.ipynb didn't go very well. 
Turns out Jupyter uses a lot of memory and my laptop can't handle it so I'm back to using a normal script.
